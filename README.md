# myPortfolio

Criteria for this project is to create a website from scratch with work that I've done. I will be using HTML to structure the website and use CSS to style it. More specifically style it dynamically with using responsive design, grid layout, box styling and flexbox for positioning. The website should have working links (jump to parts of the website when the links are clicked on) and layout of the website should also change when the browser dimensions get smaller.

The conditions are as follows:

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
